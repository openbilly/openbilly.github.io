As a bioengineering graduate, all my marketing knowledge was learned and summed up on the job. According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/70/20/10_Model_(Learning_and_Development))" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">70/20/10 Model (Learning and Development)]</a>, all I learned is from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-the-job_training" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On-the-job training</a>:

- 70% from challenging assignments
- 20% from developmental relationships
- 10% from coursework and training

There are still 30% I should learn from relationship & cousrework.

Enrolling a MBAï¼ˆMaster of Business Administration) course is no doubt a very good method. In fact, the point is not about going into a classroom or opening a book before a desk, it dosen't matter. It do matter we giving our effort in learning. This is the point.

So I launch this project to organize all my understanding of business administration. Before I started, I searched and browsed through some relevant materials and found that there is corresponding website <a href="https://personalmba.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Personal MBA</a>. I'll take it as one of my guidebooks.
